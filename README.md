# Titanic Dataset Analysis

## Overview

This project analyzes the Titanic dataset to explore factors affecting passenger survival. The dataset includes features such as class, sex, fare, and survival status.

## Key Steps

1. **Data Cleaning**:  
   - Removed columns with many missing values (`Cabin`, `Age`).
   - Dropped unnecessary columns (`PassengerId`, `Name`, `Ticket`).

2. **Exploration & Visualization**:  
   - Analyzed survival by gender, class, and embarkation point.
   - Visualized sibling distribution and its impact on survival.

## Findings

- **Gender**: Higher survival rates for females.
- **Class**: Higher-class passengers had better survival chances.
- **Embarkation**: Survival patterns varied by embarkation point.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/cyberfantics/pdf-merger
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
  ```pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn```
